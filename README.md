- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @cristiangsmiranda, but you can just call me Cristian
- ðŸ‘€ I'm currently interested in programming and web design
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Software Development from BYU-IDAHO
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? through my G-mail ( cristiangsmiranda@gmail.com ), or my linkedIn profile ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristian-gabriel-miranda-/ )
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm extremely creative and love writing books and screenplays. My personal and future goal is to develop stories that are good enough to be plots for movies, series or games that I plan to program in the future.
